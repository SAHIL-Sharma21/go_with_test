### pointers and error
 - when you call a function or a method the arguments are copied.
 - to solve this we will use pointer in this as it will give give the original value and change the original not the copy one

 - Maps allow you to store items in a manner similar to a dictionary. 
 - ou can think of the key as the word and the value as the definition.
